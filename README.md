A colour scheme for terminals, vim and friends.

This is **v2.0** - vastly improved, with more tweak, less cruft.

The aim of Falcon is a colour scheme that is a work horse that will (hopefully) stand the test of time - with fewer gimmicks, a more restrained use of colour but just enough so that everything can be distinguished, makes some kind of semantic sense with a little bit of delight thrown in..
